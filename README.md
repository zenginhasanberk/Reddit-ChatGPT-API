# Reddit Bot with ChatGPT Integration

## Description

This is the code for a sample Reddit bot that makes API calls to ChatGPT's "gpt-3.5-turbo". Upon mentioning the bot (u/myreddit-bot) and including a text to be sent to the ChatGPT API, the code makes an API call to the model with the text.

## Important Notes

The "keys.py" file is not included in the repository. That file contains private information to be able to use the Reddit and OpenAI API's. If you would like to replicate this project,
please include your own "keys.py" file with the relevant information.

## Usage

In any subreddit, reply to a user. Then, mention the user "u/myreddit-bot", followed by a space and the question you would like to ask ChatGPT. For this to work, the script has to be running! Since it is not deployed anywhere, if you test the bot it won't work right now.
